# Interests

The things which interest me the most are **Computer Vision**, **Robotics**, **Data-Visualization**, **Operating Systems** and **Networking**. I believe the key to debugging and maintainabilty of machine learning algorithms is effective visualization. I also like the challenge of writing light-weight code for real-time image processing, as required for robots. I also don't mind getting my hands dirty writing low-level C code for OS or network related tasks.

# Projects
###   Region Adjacency Graphs for scikit-image
**[Blog Posts](https://vcansimplify.wordpress.com/tag/RAG/) | [Videos](https://www.dropbox.com/sc/1rmqf3v5tip5d58/AADjpJP8uEhjCFg_qh3MZqiNa) | [Source Code](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/tree/master/skimage/future/graph)**

As a part of Google Summer of Code 2014, I implemeted Region Adjacency Graphs (RAGs) for [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/) followed by few segmentation algorithms based on them. I also wrote routines to visualize RAGs on images and used small temporary hacks to visualize the segmentation process(see Videos) step by step.

###SimpleCV Display System
**[Source Code](https://github.com/jayrambhia/SimpleCV2/tree/master/SimpleCV/Display)**

As part of Google Summer of Code 2013, I created GUI for displaying images and applying filters for [SimpleCV](http://simplecv.org/). The module handled displaying on Desktops as well as IPython Notebooks.

###Human Trained Text Summarizer
**[Source Code](https://github.com/vighneshbirodkar/summarize)**

As part of our B. Tech final year project attempted producing extractive summaries of articles by training an SVR over a human written summary.

**[Blog Post](https://vcansimplify.wordpress.com/2014/03/16/vigredis-the-story-behind/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/vighneshbirodkar/vigredis)**

Implementation of a small subset of the Redis in memory data store as part of a challenge.
